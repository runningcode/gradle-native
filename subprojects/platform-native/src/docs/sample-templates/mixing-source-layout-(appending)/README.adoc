= {c-application} Custom Source File mixing source layout (appending)
:summary: Set custom source file mixing source layout for a {c-application}.
:type: sample-chapter
:tags: sample, {application}, sources, native, {C}, gradle
:category: {C}
:description: See how to set the source file mixing source layout of {an application} implemented in {C} using the Gradle Nokee plugins.

NOTE: You can open this sample inside an IDE using the https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html#gradle_import_project_start[IntelliJ native importer] or https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.buildship[Eclipse Buildship].

Here is a sample where we set the custom source file by _mixing source layout_ also called _appending_ {an-application} implemented in {C} with no dependencies and minimal configuration.

====
[.multi-language-sample]
=====
.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
include::groovy-dsl/build.{plugin-name}.gradle[]
----
=====
[.multi-language-sample]

.build.gradle.kts

=====
====
<1> Apply the {ref-plugin}.
<2> Set {C} sources under `main.{source-file-extension}`. This section is commented to show it is set by convention and doesn't need to be implemented.
<3> Set {C} sources under `application.{source-file-extension}`
<4> Set {C} sources under `greeter.{source-file-extension}` that will append to previous command (3)

NOTE:  _from_ can take any type of source layout (globing, cherry-picking, generated).

As per below example, creating a broken source file at the conventional location will fail the build since the full sources include {txt-conventional-source-layout}; *sources/application.{source-file-extension}*; *sources/greeter.{source-file-extension}*

The {application} build fails:

[source,terminal,subs=attributes+]
----
$ mkdir -p src/main/{conventional-source-set-name}
$ echo "broken!" > src/main/c/a_broken.{source-file-extension}
$ ./gradlew clean assemble

BUILD FAIL
----
